    "text": "Approach\nThe proposed approach is designed to remain as unbiased as possible by anchoring all player evaluation to the characteristics of the existing squad in the base year. Rather than searching the entire player universe, the model identifies players from the previous season whose profiles are comparable or improve upon to the players currently occupying each role in the team. This relative, role-based comparison ensures that recommendations are contextualized within the team’s actual needs and constraints, reducing selection bias and overfitting to league-wide averages.\nBy sourcing candidates from the prior year, the approach avoids forward-looking leakage while still capturing players with demonstrated performance stability. Once candidate players are identified, the framework evaluates how one or multiple transfers would alter the team’s internal dynamics, particularly in terms of collective ability and wage structure. This allows the user to assess not only individual upgrades but also the systemic impact of transfer decisions on squad balance and total budget, supporting informed trade-offs between performance gains and financial sustainability."
